# Code of conduct

## Lab culture

It goes without saying that we strive to work in an environment that is collaborative, supportive, open, and free from discrimination and harassment, per University policies. 

We encourage students / staff of all experience levels to respectfully share their honest opinions and ideas on any topic. Our group has thrived upon such respectful honest input from team members over the years, and this document is a product of years of student and staff input (and even debate) that has gradually improved our productivity and overall quality of our work. 

## Protecting human subjects

All lab members must complete [CITI Human Subjects Biomedical Group 1](https://researchcompliance.stanford.edu/panels/hs/forms/training/citi) training and share their certificate with Jade. She will add team members to relevant Institutional Review Board protocols prior to their start date to ensure they have permission to work with identifiable datasets. 

One of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality. For students supporting our data science efforts, in practice this means: 

- If you are using a virtual computer (e.g., Bluevelvet, AWS, GHAP), never save the data in that system to your personal computer or any other computer without prior permission. 
- Do not share data with anyone without permission, including to other members of the group, who might not be on the same IRB protocol as you (check with Jade first).

Remember, data that looks like it does not contain identifiers to you might still be classified as data that requires special protection by our IRB or under HIPAA, so always proceed with caution and ask for help if you have any concerns about how to maintain study participant confidentiality. 

## Authorship

We adhere to the [ICMJE Definition of authorship](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) and are happy for team members who meet the definition of authorship to be included as co-authors on scientific manuscripts.
