# Welcome to the Benjamin-Chung Lab!

This lab manual covers our communication strategy, code of conduct, and best practices for reproducibility of computational workflows. It is a living document that is updated regularly. To learn more about our lab, visit [jadebc.net](https://jadebc.net).

This manual was created with input from a large number of team members and with inspiration from [other scientists' lab manuals](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual/blob/master/aly-lab-manual.pdf). Feel free to draw from this manual (and please cite it if you do!).
